# Laboratory tasks

Write a program in assembly code to perform the following operations. Store the result of each operation in a variable of appropiate size in memory. The name of the variables should follow the pattern `REZ_X`, where `X` will be replaced with the number of the exercise. Additionally, for each instruction perfomed, check the value of the flags.

Start writing the code in `lw5.asm`. Submit a solution at the end of the laboratory with the exercises you managed to implement.

Don't forget to initialize the necessary registers with the appropiate values before performing each operation.
